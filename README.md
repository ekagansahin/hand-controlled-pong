### Tips for Best Performance

- **Lighting**: Ensure good, even lighting on your hand
- **Background**: Use a plain background behind your hand for better tracking
- **Camera Position**: Position the camera at eye level
- **Hand Position**: Keep your hand within the camera's field of view
- **Arm Stability**: Rest your elbow on a table to reduce jitter

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

You can customize the game by modifying the `Config` class in `pong_game.py`:

```python
class Config:
    # Display settings
    FULLSCREEN = True
    DEFAULT_WIDTH = 1280
    DEFAULT_HEIGHT = 720
    
    # Game parameters
    FPS = 60
    WINNING_SCORE = 5
    OPPONENT_SPEED = 21
    SMOOTHING_FACTOR = 0.2  # Adjust hand tracking sensitivity
    
    # Ball settings
    BALL_INITIAL_SPEED_MIN = 12
    BALL_INITIAL_SPEED_MAX = 19
    
    # Hand tracking settings
    MIN_DETECTION_CONFIDENCE = 0.7
    MIN_TRACKING_CONFIDENCE = 0.5
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working

**Error**: "Error: Could not open webcam"

**Solutions**:
- Check if another application is using the webcam
- Grant camera permissions to Python/Terminal
- Try unplugging and replugging external webcam
- Update your webcam drivers

### Hand Not Detected

**Solutions**:
- Improve lighting conditions
- Move closer to the camera
- Ensure your hand is clearly visible
- Reduce background clutter
- Check that your hand is within the camera frame

### Game Running Slowly

**Solutions**:
- Close other resource-intensive applications
- Reduce screen resolution (edit `Config.DEFAULT_WIDTH` and `Config.DEFAULT_HEIGHT`)
- Lower FPS (edit `Config.FPS`)
- Ensure your computer meets minimum requirements

### Calibration Failed

**Solutions**:
- Make a larger range of motion during calibration
- Keep your arm stable during calibration
- Ensure good lighting and clear hand visibility
- Restart the game and try again
